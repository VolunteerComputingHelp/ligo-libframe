---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains two routines [loadadc, loadproc] for loading
ADC and PROC data from a given frame file into the Octave context.

GNU Octave [www.octave.org] is a high-level language, primarily intended for 
numerical computations.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
------------

1) Requirements

You need to have Octave (2.0.16 and +) installed with support
for dynamic linking.  To find out if it does, type the command

       x = octave_config_info; x.DEFS

at the Octave prompt.  Support for dynamic linking is included if
the output contains the string -DWITH_DYNAMIC_LINKING=1.

Check whether you have the compilation script for dynamically linked 
function (DLD) in your PATH. To do so, type :

      which mkoctfile

at the shell prompt. The path to this script should appear, if you have it.

You need also to have the Frame Library (v4r40 and more) and a recent version
of GNU make.

2) Install

a) cd to the frame2oct directory
b) open Makefile and put the right path to the FrameLib includes and library,
line 7: FRAME_INC = [your_path_to_FrameL.h]
line 8: FRAME_LIB = [your_path_to_libFrame.a]
c) and type make.

This should produce two .oct files :

loadadc.oct
loadproc.oct

3) Test

You may test the good functioning of the routines by running the test script
[plotframe.m] which use the test framefile [test.dat] in root/ of the Frame
Lib distribution.

a) open Octave in the frame2oct directory
b) type

      plotframe

at the Octave prompt. The script produces a plots the 1024 first data points 
of the ADC signal 'Adc0', computes and plots its spectrum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING
-------

Once compiled and tested, you should put loadadc.oct and loadproc.oct in 
your OCTAVE_PATH. To have a description of how loadadc and loadproc should 
be used, read the online help you get by entering

help loadadc
or 
help loadproc

at the Octave prompt.

REPORT BUGS
-----------

If you find errors and bugs, send a mail to ecm@obs-nice.fr with
a precise description of what the problem is, jointly to logs if
possible.
